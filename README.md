Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.  This is a
hacked/simplified version of the original
[laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) project from Thoughtbot.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* OS X Mavericks (10.9)
* OS X Yosemite (10.10)
* OS X El Capitan (10.11)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravit/mac-laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
